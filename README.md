# Course-Flow

Welcome to Schooler! The one-stop online class management system that caters to all your educational needs! Our system facilitates classroom management for both admins and users. For admins, they can organize homework distribution, curriculum management, homework grading and tracking, and document filing. Meanwhile, users can see all available class contents and materials, subscribe/unsubscribe classes, turn in their homework/projects, and view their performances.
